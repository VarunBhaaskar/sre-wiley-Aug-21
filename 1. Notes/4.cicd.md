3 A's of Security

A - Authentication
       - What you Know - Credentials (Password/PIN)
       - What you have - Token (soft and hard) 
       - What you are  - Biometrics
A - Authorization
A - Accounting (Investigation / Auditing)

Microsoft Active Directory
SSO --> Single Sign-On

ssh -i <path> root@ipaddress
