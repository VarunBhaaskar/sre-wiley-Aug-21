````

### Classroom Activity 1
````
Create an AWS Free tier account. https://aws.amazon.com/free

````

Subject - Welcome to Amazon Web Services
Sender - no-reply-aws@amazon.com


### IT Resources
- Compute (CPU+RAM)
    - Bare Metal
    - EC2
    - ECS
    - EKS
    - Lambda

- Storage
- Networking
- Databases


### Compute Evolution

- Physical Machines ---> Virtual Machines ---> Containers ---> Serverless

### EC2 Instances
- AMI
- Instance Types
- Security Groups
- Keypair
- Storage
- Networking details
- User Data


### Storage on AWS
Object Storage
  - S3
- Block Storage
  - EBS 
- File/Network Storage
  - EFS


### Class Activity 2
````
Task1:
1. Create an EC2 instance using the user data for apache
2. Take SSH access of the instance
3. Access the webserver via web browser.


Task2:
1. Create an S3 Bucket
2. Upload some sample files (preferebly images)
3. Go to Bucket Permissions --> Edit "Block public access (bucket settings)" --> Turn it "off"
4. Select the Object (image) --> Go to object properties --> Permissions --> Modify Read permissions for "Everyone (public access)" --> Allow for all
5. Access the files using a web browser (Make object/bucket public, if needed)
6. Paste the Object URL in the chat window
````

### Userdata for apache
````
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd.x86_64
systemctl start httpd.service
systemctl enable httpd.service
echo “This is an apache web server hosted on $(hostname -f)” > /var/www/html/index.html
````


### AWS access works via:
````
- Console (GUI) - User id + Password
- AWS CLI (Command Line) - Access key id + Secret access key
- SDK (Programmatic access) - Access key id + Secret access key
````

### IAM
  - User
  - Group
  - Policy


### Classroom Activity 3
````
Task 1
  - Create a user in IAM, give Admin permissions
  - Give both Programmatic and Console access
  - Once the user is created, Make sure you keep all credentials safe.

Task 2  
  - Create an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2 AMI
  - SSH into the instance

Task 3
  - SSH into your instance
  - check if aws cli is installed via "aws --version"
  - Run "aws s3 ls" and verify that it fails.
  - Run "aws configure" and provide your credentials. (Region = us-east-1, Output = none)
  - Explore ~/.aws directory to see two new files created, namely config and credentials. Check their content.
  - Run "aws s3 ls" again and it should provide an output of your Buckets list this time.

### CIDR Notations
````
1.2.3.4/16 --> 1.2.{0-255}.{0-255} --> 256x256 --> 65,536
1.2.3.4/8 --> 1.{0-255}.{0-255}.{0-255} --> 256x256x256 --> 16,777,216
0.0.0.0/0 --> Anywhere, All the IPs in the world
1.2.3.4 ===> 1.2.3.4/32
::/0 --> Anywhere (IPv6)
````

### AWS Networking
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
    - Subnets (Public and private)
    - Internet Gateway
    - Route tables
    - NAT Gateway
    - Security Groups


### Class Activity - 4 (AWS Networking)
````
Task 1 (Create VPC)

- Create a VCP with CIDR Range 10.0.0.0/16

Task 2 (Create Subnets)

- Create 1 public and 1 private subnets inside the VPC as following:
    Mypublic-1  - 10.0.1.0/24
    Myprivate-1 - 10.0.2.0/24
- Make sure you selected the option "Modify auto-assign IP settings" as a yes

Task 3 (Create Instances in newly created VPC)

- Create 2 instances, 1 each in Public and Private subnet
- Verify that instance in Public subnet has a Public IP address
- Verify that instance in Private subnet does not have a Public IP address

Task 4 (Optional Challenge - Fix SSH issue)

- Try to take SSH of Public Instance, verify that you are not able to do it.
- Make the following changes
    - Create a new Internet Gateway
    - Attach the internet Gateway to the VPC
    - Edit the route table as follows:
        - Destination - 0.0.0.0/0
        - Target - igw-xxxxxxx (Internet Gateway ID)
- Try to SSH into the instance again. This time it should be successful.
