### Classroom Activity 1
````
Create an AWS Free tier account. https://aws.amazon.com/free

````

Subject - Welcome to Amazon Web Services
Sender - no-reply-aws@amazon.com


### IT Resources
- Compute (CPU+RAM)
    - Bare Metal
    - EC2
    - ECS
    - EKS
    - Lambda

- Storage
- Networking
- Databases


### Compute Evolution

- Physical Machines ---> Virtual Machines ---> Containers ---> Serverless

### EC2 Instances
- AMI
- Instance Types
- Security Groups
- Keypair
- Storage
- Networking details
- User Data



### Storage on AWS
Object Storage
  - S3
- Block Storage
  - EBS 
- File/Network Storage
  - EFS
  - FSx


### Class Activity 2
````
Task1:
1. Create an EC2 instance using the user data for apache
2. Take SSH access of the instance
3. Access the webserver via web browser.


Task2:
1. Create an S3 Bucket
2. Upload some sample files (preferebly images)
3. Go to Bucket Permissions --> Edit "Block public access (bucket settings)" --> Turn it "off"
4. Select the Object (image) --> Go to object properties --> Permissions --> Modify Read permissions for "Everyone (public access)" --> Allow for all
5. Access the files using a web browser (Make object/bucket public, if needed)
6. Paste the Object URL in the chat window
````

### Userdata for apache
````
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd.x86_64
systemctl start httpd.service
systemctl enable httpd.service
echo “This is an apache web server hosted on $(hostname -f)” > /var/www/html/index.html
````


### AWS access works via:
````
- Console (GUI) - User id + Password
- AWS CLI (Command Line) - Access key id + Secret access key
- SDK (Programmatic access) - Access key id + Secret access key
````

### IAM
  - User
  - Group
  - Policy


### Classroom Activity 3
````
Task 1
  - Create a user in IAM, give Admin permissions
  - Give both Programmatic and Console access
  - Once the user is created, Make sure you keep all credentials safe.

Task 2  
  - Create an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2 AMI
  - SSH into the instance

Task 3
  - SSH into your instance
  - check if aws cli is installed via "aws --version"
  - Run "aws s3 ls" and verify that it fails.
  - Run "aws configure" and provide your credentials. (Region = us-east-1, Output = none)
  - Explore ~/.aws directory to see two new files created, namely config and credentials. Check their content.
  - Run "aws s3 ls" again and it should provide an output of your Buckets list this time.
